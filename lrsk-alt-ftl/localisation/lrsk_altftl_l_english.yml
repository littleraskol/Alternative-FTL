 LRSK_ALTFTL_WARP_DRIVE:0 "Warp Drive"
 LRSK_ALTFTL_WARP_DRIVE_DESC:1 "Warp Drives allow FTL travel to and from the edges of star systems, with limited range and wind-up and wind-down periods at departure and arrival."
 
 LRSK_ALTFTL_HYPER_DRIVE:0 "Hyper Drive"
 LRSK_ALTFTL_HYPER_DRIVE_DESC:1 "Ships equipped with Hyper Drives can only travel along interstellar hyperlanes, but at very high speed."
 
 LRSK_ALTFTL_WORMHOLE_DRIVE:1 "Wormhole Modulator"
 LRSK_ALTFTL_WORMHOLE_DRIVE_DESC:0 "Ships equipped with Wormhole Modulators attune the portals created by Wormhole Generators to allow for passage between systems."
 
 tech_lrsk_altftl_wormhole_generation:0 "Subspace Wormhole Projection"
 tech_lrsk_altftl_wormhole_generation_desc:0 "By tunneling directly through subspace, a temporary conduit can be established between two different points in normal space. Travel between these points would be near instantaneous.\n\n"
 
 tech_lrsk_altftl_hyper_drive:0 "Hyperspace Lane Attunement"
 tech_lrsk_altftl_hyper_drive_desc:0 "Like the strands of a spider web, the extra-dimensional realm of hyperspace runs between the gravity wells of most stars. Faster than light travel at a very high speed is theoretically possible along these hyperlanes.\n\n"
 
 tech_lrsk_altftl_warp_drive:0 "Warp Bubble Generation"
 tech_lrsk_altftl_warp_drive_desc:0 "By enveloping a vessel in a warp field and forming a subspace bubble around it, unrestricted faster than light travel is theoretically possible.\n\n"
